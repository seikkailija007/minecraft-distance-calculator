I present to you
# minecraft-distance-calculator

I have wondered "How far have i traveled?" and "How far do i to have travel?". I am currently learning programming and my school is too stupid to teach me anything. I wanted to learn and i wanted to know how far have i traveled. So i made a distance calculator for minecraft.

## Usage

You have to input the coordinates seperated with a space. If you input x, y and z coordinates it includes the y coordinate in the calculation. If you input only x and y, then it only includes x and y coordinats in the calculation.

Supports decimals too.
